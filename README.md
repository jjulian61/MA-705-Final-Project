# MA-705-Final-Project-John Julian

I did my project on the Top 40 Most Expensive Condo Listings in NYC on Zillow (As of 4-28-22)
Disclaimer: Zillow property listings are not static. Running the Cleaned Data Final Project.py file two years from now, or even a week from now will still generate the top 40 most expensive condo listings on Zillow. But, results will be different.
My Dashboard is a snapshot of these results

I wanted to examine these properties in a way that Zillow may have missed
On Zillow, in particular, only a few properties are visible at once on the scroll bar. So, I created a dashboard that simulataneously displays all relevant properties and parameters.

Python Programs Used: pandas, selenium, time, re, pickle, html, dash

Preparation Steps
1. Used selenium webdriver to extract raw data from source website
